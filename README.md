## Method to run code
This code can be easily run on Kaggle Notebook by adding the SALD dataset and changing the path to the respective directories.

## Abstract

Differentiating among brain tissues in medical imaging is an active area of research.  Previously, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures like U-Net have been implemented for tissue segmentation tasks but with limited success.  Subsequently, transformers have been used to improve tissue segmentation performance, in models like the Transformer-based Automated Brain-tissue Segmentation (TABS) model [1]. We wish to increase TABS test accuracy and performance by implementing MRI-artifact inspired online data augmentation and self-attention through Squeeze-Excitation (SE) blocks.
